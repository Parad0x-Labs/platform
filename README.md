## 🛡️ What we build

### 1. Liquefy (Data Compression)
Liquefy is a compression-native observability engine. It allows enterprise infrastructure to ingest, store, and **search** high-velocity log data while maintaining extreme compression ratios (10x–50x+). By querying data in its compressed state, we eliminate the latency and cost of traditional indexing.

### 2. Nebula Media (Media Optimization)
Nebula Media is our media optimization pipeline for images/video, focused on high quality-per-bit delivery using modern codecs and deterministic packaging.
